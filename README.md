<!--
Inspired by https://github.com/RecuencoJones/caddy-npm, but supports any version of Caddy.

TODO: Let the package.json specify a range? But then I’d have to reimplement .lock logic.

npx @leafac/caddy file-server


npm i @leafac/caddy
npx caddy (didn’t work on Windows, had to do .\node_modules\.bin\caddy)


  "caddy": "2.4.5", on package.json
