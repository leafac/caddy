<!--
Inspired by https://github.com/RecuencoJones/caddy-npm, but supports any version of Caddy.

TODO: Let the package.json specify a range? But then I’d have to reimplement .lock logic.

npx @leafac/caddy file-server


npm i @leafac/caddy
./node_modules/.bin/caddy    (npx caddy worked in macOS but not Windows)


  "caddy": "2.4.5", on package.json
